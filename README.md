### Java Programs
- [MaxHeap Data Structure Implementation](https://github.com/Brycekratzer/MaxHeap-Implementation)
  This project implements a priority queue using a max-heap array to simulate task management in Stardew Valley. Tasks are prioritized based on their importance and time of creation,          allowing efficient scheduling within the game environment. The provided classes and interfaces facilitate task generation and queue management for a realistic simulation of the game's       task prioritization system.
