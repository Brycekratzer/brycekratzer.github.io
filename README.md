# Projects
### Data Analysis Project
- [An analysis of the Top 10 NFL draft slots over the past couple years](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tRLaoVIrmgFp3AA8nEjKEp7hcsZ-tujx42oi-JyUCPY/edit?usp=sharing)
  This study aimed to investigate the potential correlation between NFL Draft position within the top 10
  selections and subsequent player performance. To achieve this objective, I analyzed various factors
  impacting player evaluation and draft selection. Ths was an individual project 
  
### C Programs
- [Shopping Cart Application](https://github.com/Brycekratzer/Shopping-Cart-Application)
  This is a simple console-based shopping cart application written in C. It allows users to add and remove
  items from their shopping cart, view item descriptions, and print an invoice with the total cost.
  
- [Writing Assistant](https://github.com/Brycekratzer/Writing-Assistant-C)
  This program is designed to analyze and manipulate user-provided text

### Java Programs
- [MaxHeap Data Structure Implementation](https://github.com/Brycekratzer/MaxHeap-Implementation)
  This project implements a priority queue using a max-heap array to simulate task management in Stardew Valley. Tasks are prioritized based on their importance and time of creation,          allowing efficient scheduling within the game environment. The provided classes and interfaces facilitate task generation and queue management for a realistic simulation of the game's       task prioritization system.
  
- [Double Linked List Implementation](https://github.com/Brycekratzer/Double-Linked-List-Implementation)
  The program is a double linked list implementation of a simulated one-level Cache and two-level Cache

- [Stack and Queue Implementation](https://github.com/Brycekratzer/Stack_and_Queue_Implementation)
  The following is an implementation of a queue and stack data structure.
