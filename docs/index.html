The hash tables store HashObject instances with keys, frequencies, and probe counts. It also includes a TwinPrimeGenerator to find twin primes within a given range.</p></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Brycekratzer/MaxHeap-Implementation">MaxHeap Data Structure Implementation</a><p>This project implements a priority queue using a max-heap array to simulate task management in Stardew Valley. Tasks are prioritized based on their importance and time of creation, allowing efficient scheduling within the game environment.</p></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Brycekratzer/Double-Linked-List-Implementation">Double Linked List Implementation</a><p>The program is a double linked list implementation of a simulated one-level Cache and two-level Cache.</p></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Brycekratzer/Stack_and_Queue_Implementation">Stack and Queue Implementation</a><p>The following is an implementation of a queue and stack data structure.</p></li></ul></div><div class="box c"><h2>C Programs</h2><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Brycekratzer/Files-And-Pointers-C/tree/main">Gradebook Application</a><p>This program is a gradebook management system that reads student data from a CSV file and performs various operations on the data. The program is written in C and consists of a main function and several supporting functions and data structures.</p></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Brycekratzer/Shopping-Cart-Application">Shopping Cart Application</a><p>This is a simple console-based shopping cart application written in C. It allows users to add and remove items from their shopping cart, view item descriptions, and print an invoice with the total cost.</p></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Brycekratzer/Writing-Assistant-C">Writing Assistant</a><p>This program is designed to analyze and manipulate user-provided text.</p></li></ul></div><div class="box personal"><h2>Personal Programs</h2><ul><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tRLaoVIrmgFp3AA8nEjKEp7hcsZ-tujx42oi-JyUCPY/edit?usp=sharing">Data Analysis Project</a><p>This study aimed to investigate the potential correlation between NFL Draft position within the top 10 selections and subsequent player performance. To achieve this objective, I analyzed various factors impacting player evaluation and draft selection. This was an individual project.</p></li></ul></div></section></main></body></html>
